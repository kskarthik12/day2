write a blog  on the different between document & window objects 

Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile and essential programming language for web development, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. To harness the full potential of JavaScript, it's crucial to understand the various objects it works with, particularly the Document and Window objects. In this blog post, we'll explore the differences between these two fundamental objects and how they play pivotal roles in web development.

Document Object

The Document object represents the web page itself. It is a crucial part of the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a programming interface for web documents. When you write JavaScript code that interacts with the HTML elements on a web page, you are essentially manipulating the Document object.

Key characteristics of the Document object include:

Hierarchy: 
The Document object is at the top of the DOM hierarchy. It serves as the entry point to access and manipulate all elements on the web page.

Content Manipulation: 
You can use the Document object to create, modify, or delete elements and content within the web page. This includes altering text, updating attributes, or changing the structure of the page.

Events: 
The Document object is responsible for handling events such as clicks, keypresses, and mouse movements. You can attach event listeners to the Document object to respond to user interactions.

Access to Elements: 
Through the Document object, you can access specific elements on the web page using methods like getElementById, getElementsByClassName, or querySelector.

Window Object

The Window object represents the browser window or tab that displays a web page. It is also part of the DOM, but it has a broader scope compared to the Document object. The Window object encapsulates not only the current page's content but also various properties and methods related to the browser itself.

Key characteristics of the Window object include:

Global Scope: The Window object is at the global scope in JavaScript. Variables and functions declared without a specific scope become properties and methods of the Window object.

Browser Properties: You can access information about the browser window, such as its size, location, and history, using the Window object. For example, you can use window.innerWidth to get the width of the browser window.

Timers and Intervals: 
The Window object allows you to set timers and intervals for executing code at specified intervals, such as setTimeout and setInterval.

Navigation: 
You can control the navigation of the browser using the Window object, including opening new windows or tabs and navigating to different URLs.

Storage: 
The Window object provides access to web storage mechanisms like localStorage and sessionStorage for storing data on the client side.

Differences Between Document and Window Objects

Scope: 
The Document object focuses on the content of the web page, while the Window object manages the browser itself, including navigation and browser-specific properties.

Hierarchy: 
The Document object is a child of the Window object. This means you can access the Document object through window.document, indicating their hierarchical relationship.

Purpose: 
The Document object is primarily used for manipulating and interacting with HTML elements and content, whereas the Window object deals with browser-level actions and properties.

Events: 
While both objects can handle events, the Document object is more concerned with user interactions within the web page, whereas the Window object manages broader events related to the browser, such as resizing or closing the window.
